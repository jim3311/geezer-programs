 In response to a input list of side lengths, the program calculates and plots a closed irregular polygon.

 I am an 83-year-old PhD physicist.  For most of my career I was a systems engineer. I retired in 2012. I have used Copilot AI to relearn how to program in python.  The python program irregular-poly-from-triangle.py is the result of my efforts to date.
